                    <p>Most managers get into leadership positions because of their <br>

                        technical skills do not automatically equal the leadership <br>
                        qualities required. After all, managers also need to know <br>
                        how to lead and support employees in the best possible way. <br>
                        This includes competencies such as clear communication, <br>
                        effective time management, and respectful manners. Only <br>
                        with those skills will you be able to create a framework <br>
                        within which employees can be successful.

                    <p>Good managers take responsibility for their decisions. They <br>
                        listen and are able to motivate employees and inspire them <br>
                        with their own vision. They are leaders that people like to <br>

                        you, coaching can help you overcome them. Coaching is not about <br>
                        investigating the causes or coming to terms with the past. A life coach <br>
                        is not a psychotherapist. Rather, it is about showing you different <br>

                        for you to achieve your goals and regain your sense of motivation <br>
                        and satisfaction.
